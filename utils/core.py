def cache_data(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    """
    Decorator for caching function results using Streamlit's `st.cache_data` mechanism.

    This decorator memoizes (stores the results of expensive function calls
    and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again) the output
    of a function. This significantly improves performance by avoiding re-execution
    of costly computations on subsequent Streamlit reruns when the inputs remain identical.

    Args:
        func (Callable): The function to be cached.

    Returns:
        Callable: The wrapped, cached function.
