    """
    Renders the tank selection dropdown menu in the Streamlit sidebar.

    This function displays a dropdown that allows the user to select an active tank.
    It manages the `tank_id` in `st.session_state` to ensure the application's
    context (e.g., displayed data, forms) is consistent with the chosen tank.

    Args:
        tank_map (Dict[int, TankRecord]): A dictionary where keys are tank IDs (int)
                                              and values are dictionaries containing tank details,
                                              particularly the 'name' which is used for display
                                              in the selectbox. The `tank_map` dictates the
                                              `options` for the selectbox and provides the
                                              `format_func` for displaying tank names.
                                              Example: `{1: {"name": "Main Tank"}, 2: {"name": "Nano Tank"}}`.

    Returns:
        None: This function renders UI elements and does not return any value.
