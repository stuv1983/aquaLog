connection.py â€“ Database Connection Manager

A simple module that provides a managed `sqlite3.Connection` to the project's
`aqualog.db` database file, ensuring a consistent and safe connection context
for all database operations.

    Provides a context-managed `sqlite3.Connection` to the project's `aqualog.db` file.

    This ensures the correct database path is used regardless of the current
    working directory. It also configures the connection for type parsing,
    dict-like row access, and strict foreign key enforcement. The connection
    is automatically closed upon exiting the context.

    Yields:
        sqlite3.Connection: A configured database connection object.
