cycle_tab.py â€“ Nitrogen Cycle Tracker

Renders the "Cycle" tab. This view visualizes the progression of ammonia,
nitrite, and nitrate levels over time to help users monitor the establishment
of their tank's biological filter. It also provides an assessment of whether
the tank appears to be fully cycled based on recent test results.

    Determines if a tank is considered "cycled" based on the last 3 water test
    results for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate.

    2. Ammonia levels have been at or below the safe limit (typically 0 ppm)
       for the last 3 tests.
